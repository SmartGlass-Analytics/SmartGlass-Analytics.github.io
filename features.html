    <h1>Features Guide for SmartGlass Analytics</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the SmartGlass Analytics documentation! This guide explains <strong>all available features</strong> in the 
    <a href="https://github.com/SmartGlass-Analytics/smartglass" target="_blank">SmartGlass App</a> and how they work.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>
        SmartGlass Analytics is a mobile application that allows real-time basketball statistics to be displayed on Brilliant Labs Frame smart glasses. 
        It integrates live data pulled from the Synergy API into an Android tablet application, which sends information to the glasses over a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection.
    </p>

    <p>
        The application uses a hybrid architecture:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> (via Chaquopy) inside the Android app fetches and processes basketball statistics from Synergy.</li>
            <li><strong>Kotlin</strong> handles the Android user interface (UI) and Bluetooth communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Bluetooth LE</strong> is used to transmit selected stats as formatted text to the smart glasses.</li>
            <li><strong>Lua scripting</strong> on the Brilliant Labs Frame renders the text display on the glasses.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>

    <h3>1. Real-Time Basketball Stats Fetching</h3>
    <p>
        The app pulls live player statistics from the Synergy API using Python code embedded in the app (via Chaquopy).
        Data includes points, assists, rebounds, field goal percentage, and more, parsed and displayed in the app.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Dynamic Player Profiles</h3>
    <p>
        The app provides a player directory for easy navigation. Users can select any Alabama player to view detailed game statistics.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Select and Send Stats to Smart Glasses</h3>
    <p>
        After selecting a player, users can <strong>choose specific statistics</strong> (such as points, rebounds, assists) by checking boxes on the player's profile screen.
        When the "Send to Glasses" button is clicked:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kotlin reads the selected stats and triggers a Python function inside the app.</li>
        <li>Python formats the message into a compact, readable string.</li>
        <li>The message is sent over Bluetooth LE to the Brilliant Labs Frame glasses.</li>
        <li>Lua scripting on the glasses renders the received text onto the heads-up display.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>No manual typing is required by the user once selections are made. The whole pipeline is automated.</em></p>

    <h3>4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Connection</h3>
    <p>
        The app automatically handles Bluetooth pairing and communication with the Brilliant Labs Frame. 
        Glasses must first be put into "Ready to Pair" mode, and permissions (Bluetooth and Location) must be granted on the tablet.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Lightweight and Expandable UI</h3>
    <p>
        The app uses Jetpack Compose for a modern, responsive UI:
        <ul>
            <li>Home Screen: Navigation hub to player stats.</li>
            <li>Player Stats Screen: Browse player profiles and game performance.</li>
            <li>Player Profile Screen: Select specific stats and send to glasses.</li>
        </ul>
        Future features like lineup-based stats, shot charts, or advanced analytics can be added easily.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Offline Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        Unit testing scripts exist for verifying API calls and Bluetooth message formatting in Python without needing the glasses connected.
    </p>

    <h2>Planned Improvements</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Improve Bluetooth reconnection stability.</li>
        <li>Enhance text formatting for even better readability on glasses.</li>
        <li>Add color-coded stats (e.g., green for strong performance) on glasses display.</li>
        <li>Integrate lineup-based statistical summaries in the UI.</li>
    </ul>
